# tabroom_auto_summarize

Generates AI-powered school-specific summaries of speech and debate competitions from Tabroom.com data.

# Website!

I now host a web version of this tool at [tabroomsummary.com](http://tabroomsummary.com). You can specify a tournament ID and a school name and it will return your summary (it may ask for a little bit of time to generate it first).

The website does have a significant cost to me, so please USE the results you generate! Edit them and put them on social media, school newsletters, and local papers. Email them to principals, parents, and school board members! I'm fine with the costs as long as it's going to a good purpose.

# Disclaimer

This is still very much a work in progress -- Tabroom supports lots of different result types and I am gradually adding support for more of them.

I am not responsible for the contents generated by this script. If it says something mean, disheartening, or offensive, please...
1. **Edit the output** before you publish anything, and
2. **Give feedback** about how to improve the software to avoid that issue in the future.

# Documentation for nerds

This section is mostly for the nerds who don't want to use the website.

## Website architecture

![image](https://github.com/benjmor/tabroom_auto_summarize/assets/44407400/b2d15de2-0b60-4687-935e-5700959d3588)

The website is powered by AWS serverless resources and Anthropic's Claude.

The main API/Lambda for handling requests uses the following logic:
1. If there is a `results.txt` file present for the given tournament and school, return `results.txt` and the underlying `gpt_prompt.txt` used to generate the results.
2. If there is a `gpt_prompt.txt` for the given tournament and school but no `results.txt`, send the `gpt_prompt.txt` file to Claude synchronously, wait for the response, then save the result to `results.txt` and display it to the user.
3. If there is no `gpt_prompt.txt` file present, kick off a process to generate `gpt_prompt.txt` files for all schools at the tournament. This is a long process, so let the user know that they should check back later.

Ideally, we never get to step 3. A batch process should look for recently-completed tournaments with results and generate prompts for them so that users don't need to spend a lot of time waiting for results.

## Running TabroomSummary locally

### Prerequisites

Python 3.7+ installed.

### Installation

1. `cd docker-deployment` 
2. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create an [OpenAI key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) and save the key to `openAiAuthKey.txt` in the same folder as the script. Remember never to upload this key anywhere (except a password manager, if you use one)! Treat it like a password.

### Example Usage

First, find the tournament ID from the Tabroom URL of the tournament you are interested in (these examples use `11111`).

### NOTES

Results generation will take approximately 5 minutes for a typical local tournament. The output will be a folder of text files and a folder of webpages with a summary/summary webpage for each school.

After generating the content, feel free to edit it as needed and post it to social media. And tell your friends if you like the project!
